# Tree-Traversal-of-Binary-Tree

* Objective: write a C++ program for constructing a heap (min heap) and printing it in three different forms.
* Input: heap operations of size n from keyboard
* Output: final shape of the constructed heap in given three forms

  - Note that n ranges from 1 to 300


* Only the following 62 characters can be inserted:
0 < 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 < 5 < 6 < 7 < 8 < 9  < A < B < C < D < E < F < G < H < I < J < K < L < M < N < O < P < Q < R < S < T < U < V < W < X < Y < Z < a < b < c < d < e < f < g < h < i < j < k < l < m < n < o < p < q < r < s < t < u < v < w < x < y < z

  - 0 ~ 9 : 48 ~ 57
  - A ~ Z : 65 ~ 90
  - a ~ z : 97 ~ 122

  - Input operations
    - “P#”: push  a character ‘#’ into the heap
    - “R”: remove the root node from the heap

  - Read from keyboard
    - The first line: a positive integer n > 0
    - The second line: n heap operations

  - Example
    9
    P9 P8 P7 P6 P5 P4 P3 P2 P1
  
  - Output Format (Console Output)
    - Confirm output1.jpg, output2.jpg
  
* Notice
  - You may use STL, e.g., algorithm and queue.
  - It should be compiled in Visual Studio 2010 or higher, or g++
